 The following src/ directory contains an MVC implementation of a tic-tac-toe game I wrote last year. The game is fairly simple, it allows for two players and keeps score as you play multiple times. This was basically an exercise in model-view-controller design, to illustrate the basic concepts of splitting software between user interfaces, logic, and user control.

To run,
Compile the main program, "javac TTTMainGame.java" and then run "java TTTMainGame"
